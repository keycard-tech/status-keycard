# What is Keycard?

Keycard is an implementation of a BIP-32 HD wallet running on Javacard 3.0.4+ (see implementation notes)

It supports among others
- key generation, derivation and signing
- exporting keys defined in the context of EIP-1581 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1581
- setting up a NFC NDEF tag

Communication with the Keycard happens through a simple APDU interface, together with a Secure Channel guaranteeing confidentiality, authentication and integrity of all commands. It supports both NFC and ISO7816 physical interfaces, meaning that it is compatible with any Android phone equipped with NFC, and all USB Smartcard readers.

The most obvious case for integration of Keycard is crypto wallets (ETH, BTC, etc), however it can be used in other systems where a BIP-32 key tree is used and/or you perform authentication/identification.

Keycard is at the center of several projects, check the [ecosystem of projects](https://github.com/keycard-tech/keycard-ecosystem-projects/) or [good first issues](https://github.com/orgs/keycard-tech/projects/1/views/2?filterQuery=good+first+issue)

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue. 

If you just want to use the Keycard as your hardware wallet there are currently three apps supporting it

1. Status [[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.status.ethereum)][[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/status-private-communication/id1178893006)]
2. WallETH [[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.walleth)]

# How to build the project?

**YOU NEED OPENJDK11 TO BUILD THIS PROJECT**

make sure your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to a working OpenJDK 11 installation. This is a prerequisite for all of the following steps.

## Get the source

Clone this repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/keycard-tech/status-keycard`

## Compilation

Run `./gradlew convertJavacard`

## Installation

Make sure the card you are trying to use is using the T=1 protocol and SCP02 with either the GlobalPlatform default keys (404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f) or the Keycard development cards key (c212e073ff8b4bbfaff4de8ab655221f), otherwise this installation method will not work and you will need to use an external tool like [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro).

1. Disconnect all card reader terminals from the system, except the one with the card where you want to install the applet
2. Run `./gradlew install`

## Testing

Run `./gradlew test`

if you want to test using the simulator instead of a real card, create a file named `gradle.properties` with the content:

```im.status.keycard.test.target=simulator```

before running the tests.

# What kind of smartcards can I use? 

* The applet requires JavaCard 3.0.5 or later.
* The class byte of the APDU is not checked since there are no conflicting INS code.
* The GlobalPlatform ISD keys are set to 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f or c212e073ff8b4bbfaff4de8ab655221f.

The algorithms the card must support are at least:
* Cipher.ALG_AES_BLOCK_128_CBC_NOPAD
* Cipher.ALG_AES_CBC_ISO9797_M2
* KeyAgreement.ALG_EC_SVDP_DH_PLAIN
* KeyAgreement.ALG_EC_SVDP_DH_PLAIN_XY
* KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP (generation of 256-bit keys)
* MessageDigest.ALG_SHA_256
* MessageDigest.ALG_SHA_512
* RandomData.ALG_SECURE_RANDOM
* Signature.ALG_AES_MAC_128_NOPAD
* Signature.ALG_ECDSA_SHA_256

Best performance is achieved if the card supports:
* Signature.ALG_HMAC_SHA_512
